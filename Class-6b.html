            <h2>Process Information</h2>
            <p>Information is processed with circuits. Each circuit carries one byte of information and is carried by a wire, the computer uses tons of tiny little binary processes and combine those together to achieve a result and then store that result. This is done over and over again until the information is ready to be output.</p>

            <h2>Output</h2>
            <p>This is what the copmuter sends back to the user. Once again, this can be just about anything like a screen.</p>
