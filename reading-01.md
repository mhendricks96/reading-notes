# ES6 classes

## Video and Reading

* classes simplify making multiple objects.

* once a constructor is created for a class, that same contructor can be used for sub-classes that have the same attributes as the parent class.

* any new attributes or methods can be added without having to manually create a prototype.

* super can be useed to create a new constructor for a subclass.

* keyword "extends" creates a subclass.
