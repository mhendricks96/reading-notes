## Machine learning

- classifier: the more training daa you have, the better classifier you can build

### supervised learning

- collect training data
- train classifier
- make predictions

- machine learning is a comprehensive approach to soling problems

- explicit programming vs. machile learing

- the model is a set of patterns learned from data

- the training data is the dataset from which the algorithm learns the model

- the target variable is what you are trying to predict

- features are variables or columns in the dataset used to train the model

- observations are data points in the dataset

### 3 elements of ml

- skilled cheff
- fresh ingredients
- dont overcook

### Exporatory analysis

- getting to know the data

- plot numerical distributions

- look for things that dont make sense

- study correlations

### Data cleaning

- better data beats fancier algos

- remove unwanted observations

- fix structural errors

- deal with missing data

### Feature Engineering

- creating new model input features from your existing ones

- the process of addition

- requires domain expertise
