# SSH

- Secure Shell, is a remote administration protocol that allows users to control and modify their remote servers over the Internet

- Any Linux or macOS user can SSH into their remote server directly from the terminal window

- the advantage of SSH is the use of encryption to ensure secure transfer of information between the host and the client

- Symmetric encryption is a form of encryption where a secret key is used for both encryption and decryption of a message by both the client and the host

- asymmetrical encryption uses two separate keys for encryption and decryption
