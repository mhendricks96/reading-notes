# What makes a good team?

This article was basically about google researching what makes good teams. They found that the types of people and personalities dont really matter and no particar types made better teams.

What did make a difference was the enviornment. When team members feel emotionally safe, you will always get better ideas and work than when poeple fee scared of judgement. There was no concrete ways of creating an emotionally safe team, but thats where leadership comes in.
