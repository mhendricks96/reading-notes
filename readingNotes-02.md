# Reading 2 Notes

## Testing

* Test Driven Development (TDD) helps to creat software design first. Once you have well established tests driving what you want to accomplish, it all becomes about finding ways to accomplish those and pass the tests.

* Using Tests will make code more reliable because you know it will do what it is supposed to.

* AAA: Arrange, Act, Assert

* Test names should be very specific and tell exactly what the test is doing.

* The test name should match the module it is testing.

* Tests should be in their own folder.

## Recursion

* Recursion is the pricess in which a function calls itself either directly or indirectly.

* Direct recursion is when a function is called inside of itself.

* indirect recursion is when a function contains a second function which contains the first function.

* Tallied recursion is when the recursive call is the last thing executed by the function.

* A downside of recursion is that it can often take up extra memory soace and time because each step must be solved for the precious step to work all the way to the base.

## Modules

* Modules are way of breaking up programming stasks into smaller, reusable parts.

* Modules can than be imported into scripts to do things.

* Modules can then be changed without worring about anything else in the code being affected.

* Modules can be grouped together into packages
