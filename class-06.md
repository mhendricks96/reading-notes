# Class 6 Reading/ Objects and DOM trees

## Understanding the Problem Domain

This was basically explaining how understanding the problem is the most critical part of the equation. just like putting together a puzzle, coding is alot easier when you have a clear picture of what you are supposed to be doing.

## Objects

Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model of something you would recognixe from the real world.

In an object, variables and functions take on new names.

* variables are known as properties and tell us about the object.
* functions are known as methods and are tasks that are associated with the object.

### Creating an object

#### An object is created with **Literal Notation**

#### An object is accessed with  **Dot Notation**

With dot notation, to access a property or method of an object, you use the name of the object , followed by a period, then the name of the property or method you would like to access.

## D.O.M.

* Stands for document object model.

* specifies the way in which the browser should structure the model using a DOM tree.

* A DOM tree is a model of a webpage.

* Also defines methods and properties to access and update each object in the model.

* Also known as API or Application Programming Interface.

### 4 Types of Nodes in a DOM tree

#### Document Node

* represents the entire page
* Is the starting point for all visits to the DOM tree.

#### Element Node

* To access the tree, you start by lookiing for elements

* You must go through the elements to access the text and attribute nodes you want.

#### Attribute Node

attribute nodes are part of the elements that carry them

#### Text Nodes

* text nodes cannot have children

* are always a new branch of the DOM tree, and no further branches come of of it.
