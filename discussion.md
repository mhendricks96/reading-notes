**Markdown syntax**
Most of the reading today centered around markdown syntax. Being knowledgable in how to write clear markdown will be usefull no matter the system. Much of the syntax is similar to html except a little easier to write and read.

**GitHub**
The rest of our reading focused on GitHub, this is where we will be writing and sharing most of our code. To be honest, I'm not very confident on GitHub at all and am looking to become more proficient and sharing what I need to.
