# Reading Notes 5

## Linked Lists

* notes are individual items that live in a linked list. Each node contains the data for each link

* A linked list is a sequence of nodes that are connected to each other

* each node references the next node in the list.

* in a doubly linked list each node also references the previous node in the list

* next refers to the next node

* head refers to the first node in the list

* tail refers to the last node

* current refers to the node that is currently being looked at

* cannot use for loops on a linked lists, must use while loop

* you can add a node with the add function and making the new node the head

* you can insert a node into the middle of a linked list with the addbefore or addafter method.

* Linked Lists are linear data structures which means there is a sequence and order to how it is constucted and traversed like a game of hopscoth

* linked lists are also dynamic data structures which means they can shrink and grow in size without a set amount of memory bing allocated
