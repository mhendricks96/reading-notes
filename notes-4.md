### TDD

- gives you a clear outline of what the code needs to accomplish

- dont write unnecessary code

- helps make sure everthing is wired up before wasting time.

- one downside of TDD is that any changes in the app requires heavy changes to the testing suite

### before/after 

- beforeEach() is for anything that you want to happen before every test is run.

- afterEach() is for anything that you want to happen after every test is run.
