# Reading 6 Notes

## Risk Analysis

* The process of identifying the risks in applicatios or software.

* Determining the risks helps decide whether or not something is safe to try or has too much downside.

* "effect" is the impact that could be caused by the risk.

* "Cause" is the root reason for the risk.

* "Likelihood" is the chances of the risk cauing problems.

## Random Module

* Used when we want the computer to pick a random number ina a given range, pick a random element from a list, pick a random card from a deck, flip a coin, etc.

* import using "import random"

* .randint() accepts 2 parameters and generates a random number between the 2

* .random finds random number between 0 and value multiplied by .random()

* .choice() generates a random value from a list or other data stucture

* .shuffle() shuffles elements elements in place so they are in a random order

* .randrange() generates a randomly selected element from range(start, stop, step)

## Big-O notation

* A way of calculating the "complexity" of an algorithm

* single operation, regardless of size are "n"

* multiple n's(like 5n) are always reduced down to just n

* only care about braud overview of how complex the algorithm gets as the input grows.
