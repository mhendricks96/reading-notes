# Node.js

Node is the back end version of javascript. It is cool because it allows you to use the same language for front and back end.

Node is built on an open-source Javascript engine called V9 by google chrome.

Node should be installed into each individul project similar to react.

Node is event drivien and one of the biggest reason to use it is to be able to tell code to not run until you want it to.
