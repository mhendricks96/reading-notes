## Hash Tables

- Hashing is a technique that is used to uniquely identify a specific object from a group of similar objects

- An element is converted into an integer by using a hash function. This element can be used as an index to store the original element, which falls into the hash table.

- The element is stored in the hash table where it can be quickly retrieved using hashed key.

- A hash function is any function that can be used to map a data set of an arbitrary size to a data set of a fixed size, which falls into the hash table

- A hash table is a data structure that is used to store keys/value pairs

- Quadratic probing is similar to linear probing and the only difference is the interval between successive probes or entry slots.
