**My name is Michael Hendricks. I am a Veteran and former bartender [at Imperial in Portland](https://pdx.eater.com/2020/9/29/21492980/imperial-the-crown-closing) looking for a new career.**
*My end goal is a career in cyber security and I am hoping to start with a solid coding/development foundation*

I believe having a growth mindset will be especially important for me as I am beginning without any technical background. I will have to work hard to stay caught up and I have to remember that is part of what makes it so fun and challenging.
