# Stacks and Queues

Both stacks and queues are data structures consisting of nodes

## Stacks

### Stack Terminology

* **Push** - to insert a node into a stack

* **Pop** - to remove a node from a stack

* **Top** - the top of the stack

* **Peek** = to view the value of the top node of the stack

* **IsEmpty** - returns true when stack is empty and false otherwise

## Stack usage

* Stacks are First In Last Out (filo)

* the fist thing added will be the last one taken out (like a dogpile)

* any new addition becomes the new top

* popping takes the top and the next up becomes the top

## Queues

### Queue Terminology

* **Enqueue** - to insert a node into a queue

* **Dequeue** - to remove a node from a queue

* **Front** - the front/first node of the queue

* **Rear** - the rear/last node of the queue

* **Peek** = to view the value of the front node of the queue

* **IsEmpty** - returns true when queue is empty and false otherwise

## Queue usage

* Stacks are First In First Out (fifo)

* the fist thing added will be the first one taken out (like a dmv line)

* any new addition becomes the new rear
