## Why a growth mindset is important
1. It keeps you motivated even when stuck on a problem.
2. It keeps you in a minset to never stop learning.
3. It keeps you from getting down when it seems like theres no hope.

## How I plan on staying in a growth mindset
- Look for ispiration from those who have been successful
- Remember that it will be hard until its easy, and then it will be hard again.
- Always be ready to learn more.


**My name is Michael Hendricks. I am a Veteran and former bartender [at Imperial in Portland](https://pdx.eater.com/2020/9/29/21492980/imperial-the-crown-closing) looking for a new career.**
*My end goal is a career in cyber security and I am hoping to start with a solid coding/development foundation*

I believe having a growth mindset will be especially important for me as I am beginning without any technical background. I will have to work hard to stay caught up and I have to remember that is part of what makes it so fun and challenging.
