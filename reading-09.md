# Functional coding

This reading wasnt really any new information, but more about remembering to think about the concepts we already know. A function should only do one thing and that helps the code to be more human readable. it also helps because if you need to change a part of the code, it doesnt break the whole function, bucase thne change can only affect 1 specific part.
