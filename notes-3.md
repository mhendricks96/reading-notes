# Reading 3 notes


## Terms

- Middleware: any functions between the request and response

- request object: is sent from the client to the server asking it for something.

- response object: is sent from the server to the client after doing something.

- application middleware: is on the application level and covers every request sent to the server.

- routing middleware. this are functions that are not done on every request. they use next() to call the next function depending on what you want to do.

- TDD: Test driven development uses testing to guide the development. Instead of writing code and then writing tests for it, you first write the tests that you want to pass, and then write the code to make it pass.

- Behavioral Testing: testing how the app behaves in the hands of the users. can only be done manually.
