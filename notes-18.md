# Reading 18 Notes

## AWS: API, Dynamo and Lambda

### Describe a use case for a serverless function

some use casese include workloads that are asynchronous, concurrent, infrequent, or in sporadic demand. You dont want to be paying for something while you dont need it, so this is a way to only use what you need.

### If you were to create a system that emulated Lambda functions, how would you do it?

I think a server with a bunch of different listening events all in their own modules
