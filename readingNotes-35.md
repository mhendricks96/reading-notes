# Graphs

- a non-linear data structure that

- composed of verices and edges

- The neighbors of a node are its adjacent nodes, i.e., are connected via an edge

- The degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to that vertex

- An Undirected Graph is a graph where each edge is undirected or bi-directional. This means that the undirected graph does not move in any direction

- A Directed Graph also called a Digraph is a graph where every edge is directed

- A complete graph is when all nodes are connected to all other nodes

- A connected graph is graph that has all of vertices have at least one edge

- A disconnected graph is a graph where some vertices may not have edges

- An acyclic graph is a directed graph without cycles

- A Cyclic graph is a graph that has cycles

- Adjacency list is how we represent graphs(can also use adjacency matrix)

- A weighted graph is a graph with numbers assigned to its edges
