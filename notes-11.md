## Event Driven Applications

- Access Control is important so that users can only access the areas that you want them to be able to access

- Any sort of parental control app would need access control so that only certain people could change the settings.

- A role is how we separate who has access to what.

- role base access is easily scalable because once you give someone a role, their entire access ability is takenn care of.
