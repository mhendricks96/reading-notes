# Reading Notes 41

## React 41

### Deployment

- The vercel platform is created by the creators of next.js

- code should be pushed to github before deployment

- with cercel pages that use Static Generation and assets (JS, CSS, images, fonts, etc) will automatically be served from the Vercel Edge Network, which is blazingly fast

- also, with vercel, pages that use Server-Side Rendering and API routes will automatically become isolated Serverless Functions. This allows page rendering and API requests to scale infinitely

- can also create a custom domain

- can preview deployment before actually shipping
