## Solving Problems

### Common Mistakes

- trying to start coding right away

- trying to 'oversolve' the solution

### simple set of steps

- Read the problem completely twice.

- Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.

- Optimize the manual steps.

- Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.

- Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.

- Optimize the real code.

## The 5 Why's

- Assemble a team

- define the problem

- ask the first "why" 5 times

### How does JS actually work?

- javascript is single threaded

- when we call something we add to the stack

- when we return something we pop off the stack

- blocking come from slow things in the stack

- this is how the browser gets 'stuck'

- the solution is usually asynchronous callbacks

- the webapi is what does things while the stack continues

- once the webapi is finished, it pushes whatever it ran to the 'task' queue'

- THE 'EVENT LOOP' IS WHAT RUNST WHAT IS NEXT IN THE CALL STACK. IF THE CALL STACK IS EMPY, IT PUSHES ANYTHING IN THE TASK QUEUE TO THE STACK AND CALLS IT
