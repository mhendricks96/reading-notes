# Operators

## Comparison operators
- comparison operators always result in a boolean
- used to compare one value in the script to what you might expect it to be.

## Logical operators
- logical operators allow you to compare the results of more than one comparison operator.

# Loops

- checks a condition
- if it returns true a code block will run
- checks condition again
- if it returns true a code block will run
- checks condition again
- keeps running code block until condition returns false.

# 3 types of Loops

## For Loops
for loops are used for runniing code a specific number of times.

## While Loops
while loops are used when you dont know how many times the code should run

## Do While Loops
similar to while loop except it will always run the statement at least once

## But what is a condition
A condition is made up of 3 statements

### Initiation
- create a variable and set it to 0
- commonly set to i

### Condition
- the loop should continue to un until the counter reaches a specified number.

### Update
- every time the loop has run the statement in the curley braces it adds one to the counter.
