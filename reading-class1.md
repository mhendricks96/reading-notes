# Reactjs

- react is a javascript library that uses componets to know what to display.

- A component takes parameters called *props* and returns a hierarchy of views to display via the render method.

- The render menthod returns a react element that is in a syntax called JSX

the simplist way to put it is it feels like React is a combination of javascript and html. we are using JSX to inser ppieces of html type script into our javascript.
