## What Google learned about the perfect Team

This article was basically about google reaserching what makes great teams. They found that the types of people and personalities dont really matter and no particular types made better teams.

Whad did make a difference was the enviornment. When team members feel emotionally safe, you will always get better ideas and work than when people feel scared of judgement. There was no concrete ways of creating an emotionally safe team, but thats where the leadership comes in.

This was about sharing things. its is abbout how http is a precess of getting information and how there are "nouns" that we share across the internet.
