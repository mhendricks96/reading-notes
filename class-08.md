## Positioning Schemes

### Normal Flow

Every block level element appears on a new line, causing each item to appear lower down than the previous one. The paragraphs appear one after the other, vertically down the page.

### Relative Positioning

Moves an element from the position it would be in normal flow, shifting it to the top, right, bottom, or left of where it would have been placed.

### Absolute Positioning

This positions an element in relation to its containing element. basically, it stays in the same spot and dowsnt push other elements away.

### Fixed Positioning

Positions an element in relation to the browser window as opposed to the containing element.

### Floating Element

Can take an element out of normal flow and move it around. Other elements will flow around it.
