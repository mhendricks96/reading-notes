# Reading Notes 1

## Pain and Suffering

The difference between pain and suffering is mindset. This reading made it clear that the only way to keep going is to remember why we are doing this. Its like being in the middle of a hard workout. Of course it hurts, but it is alot easier if you remember that you are training for something, not just lifting heavy things for no reason

## BIG-O

Big-O is a method of measuring and describing the perfomance of an algorithm. algorithms take more time depending on the input and big-o describes the rate at which the calculations become more complex depending on the input. It uses N as the basic measurement. it seems like the more complicated you are doing something with N the longer it will take. so just multiplying by N will take less time than squaring N, etc.
