# Thinking in React

This doc was about building a "mock" or wireframe of sorts for a react app. If you draw out the app page, it is easier to pick out every seperate component. drazing boxes around every component also lts us see what the parent child of every component is because of the box it is nested in.

Once you have a boxed out mock, you can make a heirachy of all the parrents and children which makes it clear to see what needs to be passed down through props and up through funcions.

Once you know how everything is being passed statically with props, you can start passing things dynamically by switching some out for state.
