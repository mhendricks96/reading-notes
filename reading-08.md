## REGEX

* regex is used for extracting information from text.

* it is used by searching for one or more search patterns.

## API Best Practice

* an API should be accessible by any client.

* you should be able to add to the API without interupting what is already working.

* REST API's are better than just http.

* API's should be organized around resources.

* the client can ask for specific things instead of recieving everything every time.
