# Reading 4 Notes

## Classes and Objects

### Classes

* A template for creating objects

### Objects

* An ecapulation of cariables and functions into a single entity

## Thinking Recursively

* A recursive function is defined in terms of itself via referental expressions.

* A recursive function will continue to call itself and repeat its behavior until some condition is met to return a result.

* Recursiveness is about delegating respoinsibility in a function to a function further down the line

* A data structure is recursive if it can be defined in terms of a smaller version of itself(lists, sets, dictionaries, tees, etc).

* Recursive data structures work well in recursive functions

* "caching" can help make recursiv functions more efficient.

## Pytest Fixtures and Coverage

### Fixtures

* fixtures in pytest are a way to make some objects available to all of your tests.

* fixtures are defined using a combination of the pytest.fixture decorator.

* setting the fixtre scope will set where the test will execute.

### Coverage

* coverage tells how many possibilites of the code have been tested.

* need to install pytest.cov

* run --cov and then turn report into something human readable and check report on web.
