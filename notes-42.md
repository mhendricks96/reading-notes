## Ethics

### The code I am still ashamed of

This article is about someone being asked to create a site that would push the employers drug to anyone who took the quiz. The question is really how morally resposnsible for the actions of your billion dollar employer. I dont believe the point of the aritcle was "legality" because that would be a different discussion. I do believe more than one thing can be true. One can believe something is unethical, and still see the reason to do it. There are unethical things that happen all around us, and most of them are completely out of our control. I also believe that if you have the ability to do the right thing that you absolutely should.

### Self driving car Ethics

This article was mostly about protecting people in self-driving cars. since there are alot of factors outside of the normal driving ones(bad drivers, random pedestrians, etc) there needs to be contingency plans for when something goes wrong. This is a tough one, because i feel like it really depends on the rules of the road which are obviously different everywhere. All i know is that the least amount of harm, i just dont know who and what is defined as the least harm.
